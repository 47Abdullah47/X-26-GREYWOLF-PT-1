**📣AN IMPORTANT NOTICE**<br>
                         Many of the veiwers may resemble it with **F-35**or**F-22** ,but its not ,Its a blend of **F-35,F-22&F-16**
                         u may find some parts similar but lemme tell u if u look at the intakes they are similar to F-22's ,
                         If u look at the vertical tails and engine u'll find them similar to F-35,And If someone may look at
                         The airframes they are enhanced form of F-16's Air frames.
                         Therefore PLZ do not mix it with Any other Aircraft,I shall be thankful to u.

## Breif Interview Of THE WOLF🐺

This wolf is the first PT(prototype) of the series **GREY WOLF**
The PT-1 is single engine powered ,running about **1.3-1.5**meters long ,standing almost **30 cm**tall ,and going almost a **meter wide** .
Resembles a Symbol of my creativity and seriousness in the Aviation feild.

## Materials List
The list of materials used is as follows:-
- **DEPRON** for surface covering and making inner supports maybe.
- **CARBONFIBRE** for making spars,ribs,and frames whih are going to hanlde some aerodynamic stress.
- **PLYWOOD** suplmentary material in case of not usin the fibre
- **PCB's** for the transmitting and reciving board
<br><br>
## Electronics List🔌
The lsit of electronics used are:-
- **Sg-90 Servo** 180 degree rotating servo, for gaining control over control surfaces.
- **80mm Edf**  The power unit thats gonna pwerup the whole jet.
- **Fpv CAM**(for future use)not currently deployed.
- **22.2v 6000mah Lipo**for running these heavy electronics.
- **PCB**
- **Max-M10s gps chip**
- **SX1278 lora chips**
- **PE4259 rf switches**
- **TPS 79333 voltage regulator**for extra safe voltage input
- **Small LED lights** for night flight purpose
- **5v lipo** for tranmitter ,reciver and radar modules

## Credits💼📜
First of all I'm gonna Credit my **Father** he taught me almost everything about the aircrafts
He's a professional in his feild ,and He is the who encouraged me to build this project..

Secondly My **Big Bro** he was the atual reason i built it ,cuz he challenged me to make my own one
And hes the one who told me about **Blueprint**.So if he wouldnt have challenged me ,my mind  wouldnt have accelerated those ideas that 
led me to design this beast.

Thirdly **Hackclub Blueprint**
I wanna thank the team for starting this type of projects ,that enables many teenagers to enhance thier skills
Also because of **Blueprint** the project that was only a cad file ,is going to come to life.
