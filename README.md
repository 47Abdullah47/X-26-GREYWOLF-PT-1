## Breif Interview Of THE WOLF🐺

This WOLF, not a literal one, is the first PT(prototype) of the experimental plane series **GREY WOLF** 
The PT-1 is single engine (not a literal engine could be in future)powered ,running about **1.3-1.5**meters long ,standing almost **30 cm**tall . 
The WOLF has a wingspan of almost **a meter** and a wing area of a **meter** too. Has a total of **8 control surfaces** Two of 'em are flaps,two ailerons ,two stabilators, and two rudders ,not rudders but whole moving tails.Also features three landing gears all of 'em with openning and closing bays.Also in this prototype i've designed my own type of somewhat lookin like S-duct ,Just to study the effects of air in turbulence while flying at low altitudes at high speeds.Expected speeds are like 150-250 mph ,result of edfs 3.4-4kg thrust and planes empty weight being 1.5-2 kgs ,looks a big number but thts a rough guess and the weight can be reduced in real life development.  
Abt the electronic part .This beast has a spotter board and an on-board RADAR .<br><br>

## Materials List
The list of materials used is as follows:-
- **DEPRON** for surface covering and making inner supports maybe.
- **CARBONFIBRE** for making spars,ribs,and frames whih are going to hanlde some aerodynamic stress.
- **PLYWOOD** suplmentary material in case of not usin the carbon fibre. maybe i wont use this.
<br><br>
## Electronics List🔌
The lsit of electronics used are:-
- **Sg-90 Servo** 180 degree rotating servo, for gaining control over control surfaces.
- **80mm Edf**  The power unit thats gonna pwerup the whole jet.
- **22.2v 6000mah Lipo**for running these heavy electronics.
- **PCB** for the spotter board.
- **Small LED lights** for night flight and night landing purpose
<br><br>
**📣AN IMPORTANT NOTICE**<br>
                         Many of the veiwers may resemble it with **F-35**or**F-22** ,but its not ,Its a blend of **F-35,F-22&F-16**
                         u may find some parts similar but lemme tell u if u look at the intakes they are similar to F-22's ,
                         If u look at the vertical tails and engine u'll find them similar to F-35,And If someone may look at
                         The airframes they are enhanced form of F-16's Air frames.
                         Therefore PLZ do not mix it with Any other Aircraft,I shall be thankful to u.

## Credits💼📜
First of all I'm gonna Credit my **Father** he taught me almost everything about the aircrafts
He's a professional in his feild ,and He is the who encouraged me to build this project..

Secondly My **Big Bro** he was the atual reason i built it ,cuz he challenged me to make my own one
And hes the one who told me about **Blueprint**.So if he wouldnt have challenged me ,my mind  wouldnt have accelerated those ideas that 
led me to design this beast.

Thirdly **Hackclub Blueprint**
I wanna thank the team for starting this type of projects ,that enables many teenagers to enhance thier skills
Also because of **Blueprint** the project that was only a cad file ,is going to come to life.
